## Setup

First, download all files to your local drive. It's recommended to setup a conda environment to run these Jupter Notebooks from. An environment.yml file is included for this purpose.

To create an environment from the environemnt.yml file, run the following commands:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

For more information on managing conda environments, see: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

Then activate the environment by running:

`source activate ChargeUp` (Mac OS) or `activate ChargeUp` (Windows)

Then launch Jupyter Notebook by running:

`jupyter notebook`

Jupyter Notebook should launch in your browser. From there, you can select the notebooks to run.
